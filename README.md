# Lab-6

In this lab we are supposed to read data from one of our sensors. On our project board.
However, the professor alowed us to do something diffrent for the final project.

We are making a am/fm radio with two way communication. SO it doesnt have the sensors that are listed in the lab sheet.
Since we have not fully finished building this project we cannot read the data off of it.
So instead I am using the MSP430 and reading the data of the temperature sensor.

Due to this we will only be able to read data from one sensor. Since the MSP430 has only one sensor.
We know how to read from two and on our final project we will have that. 

I know the lab requires us to read from to sensors from the second part but due to our constraints we will
only be able to do question one.
